See  https://hatmarch.github.io/container-workshop/[workshop documentation] for assets generated from this workshop

[IMPORTANT]
.This repo uses git lfs
====
This repo uses *Git Large File Storage* (git lfs) to store the binary assets therein (e.g. rpms, images, etc)

If you clone the repo and find that all the images appear to have been modified and/or you are not able to view images with errors like this (from Image Preview within VSCode): 

image::lfs-issue.png[]

you can remedy this by making sure you have installed the lfs extension for git on your local machine per link:https://git-lfs.github.com/[these instructions]

_NOTE: If you run this repo inside VSCode remote, the git client will have git lfs already installed_

Once the `git lfs` plugin is available, you can pull down any missing images/binaries with the following command: 

----
git lfs pull origin
----
====

== Documentation Updates

Documentation is generated by antora.  The easiest way to generate the documentation is to run this repo within Visual Studio with Remote Container extensions enabled.  See link:https://hatmarch.github.io/java-operator-sdk-tutorial/java-operator-tutorial/demo/setup.html[here] for more info.

[TIP]
.If you are running Fedora with podman
====
If you are running Fedora and want to use VSCode with `podman` as your runtime 

image::vscode-remote-podman.png[]

Then make sure to set the following before starting up vscode (so that it uses the proper Dockerfile target)

----
export DEVCONTAINER_TARGET_PREFIX=podman
----

====

Once running the project within Visual Studio Code Remote Development Containers (or locally on a system with the proper npm libraries installed), you can run the following command in the terminal:

[NOTE]
====
npm install command is only necessary _the first time you run this_
====

----
npm install 
gulp
----

This will run a javascript process that will build the documentation according to link:dev-site.yml[dev-site.yml], host it locally, and watch the relevant directories so that you can see changes in real time.

Documentation files can be found in the `${DEMO_HOME}/documentation` directory

== Publish documentation

When you are happy with the documentation changes, you can run the following command to deploy these changes externally (based on the contents of link:site.yml[site.yml])

----
${DEMO_HOME}/scripts/github-pages-publish.sh
